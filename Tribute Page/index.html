                The Banaue Rice Terraces, often referred to as the "Eighth Wonder of the World," were carved into the mountains of Ifugao in the Philippines by ancestors of the indigenous people. These terraces were built 2,000 years ago and are still in use today. 
                The irrigation system taps water from the rainforests above the terraces, showcasing the ingenuity of ancient Filipino farmers.
